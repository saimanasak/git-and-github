### Git  
- Git is a free open source version control system that allows to track the changes of the files and to collaborate the work among multiple developers.  
- Git is known as a Version Control System (VCS).  
- It runs locally on a machine.  
- Other than git, there are many other alternatives like Mercurial, Subversion (SVN), Perforce (Helix Core), CVS etc...

### Version Control System:  
- It is also known as Versioning or Source Control.  
- It is a software that helps to manage and track changes to the files over time.  
- It allows users to revisit the earlier versions of the files, compares the changes between the versions, undo the changes and so on...  
- Generally, the main purpose is to facilitate the collaboration among the multiple developers working on a shared project and to keep the history of the changes that are made in the project.  
- There are two types of VCSs:  
    1. **CVCS** - Centralized Version Control System
        - It acts like a central server to store all the files.  
        - Each of the user gets their own copy using a single central repo/server.  
    2. **DCVS** - Distributed Version Control System  
        - It has multiple repos to store the files. 
        - Where each user gets a complete project into theie local and can merge it with the main repo after making the changes.  
- Why DCVS over CVCS???
    - High Felixibility
    - Faster Performance
    - Enhanced Collaboration
    - Decentralized
    - Offline Work  

### Why Git???
- It tracks the changes across multiple files.  
- It compares all the versions of a project.  
- Works like a "Time Machine" where we can go back to the old versions.  
- Can revert back to the previous versions.  
- Can collaborate and share the changes.  
- Changes can be combined.
